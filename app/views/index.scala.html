                    <p>Children thrive outdoors, which is why the Outdoor Preschool program is based in nature. Children
                        are supported by compassionate and skilled educators who enjoy being outside, caring for and
                        learning from children’s unique curiosity and perspectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Outdoor Preschool program was established in Vermont in June of 2015 by Annabelle Knight. The idea
                        began in California in 2012 while Annabelle was working for Google Inc. As an educator
                        at one of their childrens’ centers, she examined how nature walks impacted children’s and
                        adult’s experience of the natural world and enjoyment of learning. Her interest led her to seek an internship with
                        the owner and lead teacher of Leaping Lizards, an entirely outdoor preschool in Northern
                        California. After a few weeks working alongside Magdalena Cabrera, Annabelle began to search
                        for a location to found a new nature-based school on the east coast.

                    <p>Annabelle Knight is the Founder, Director and Lead Educator of Outdoor Preschool. Annabelle’s
                        appreciation for the outdoors began in her childhood near Portland, Maine. She graduated from
                        Boston University in 2010 and earned a Master’s degree in Early Childhood Education from Lesley
                        University in 2011. Since 2009, Annabelle has travelled over 1,200 miles of the Appalachian

                        Annabelle is passionate about working, learning and playing alongside children and she is driven
                        to share the benefits of outdoor learning experiences with children and families.

                            <p>Our program offers children a dynamic
                                and engaging, culturally responsive environment that supports the whole child (physical,
                                emotional, social and cognitive development and well-being). The program integrates many
                                foundational skills: critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, cooperation, social and
                                environmental responsibility. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Each day of our program is guided by children’s play, interactions with their environment
                                and daily routines. We provide children with ample free time for unstructured play,
                                which is a child’s primary mode of learning. Educators encourage experiential, hands-on
                                learning, which allows children’s play, imagination and imitation to guide everyday
                                work. The physical environment is an unlimited source of rhythm, meaningful patterns and
                                daily inspiration. We regularly incorporate the use of photos, videos, fine arts
                                materials, music as well as natural materials found on our grounds. Throughout the year,
                                children contribute their work to a portfolio as evidence of their progress in the
                                program. The portfolio is used during conferences to reference a child’s work and is
                                always accessible for families to see.

                            <p>
                                The mission of Outdoor Preschool is to provide children with time to explore, appreciate
                                and connect with their environment while building a variety of essential life skills.
                                Outdoor Preschool strives to cultivate an inclusive community of lifelong learners and
                                ecologically conscious citizens through nurturing strong, respectful partnerships among
                                adults, children and the natural world. We value and advocate for families’ voices,
                                diversity, unique perspectives and expert knowledge of their children. Outdoor Preschool
                                does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religious beliefs, national
                                and ethnic origin, age, socioeconomic status, marital status, family structure,
                                disability, or sexual orientation.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Outdoor Preschool program combines play-based and child-led philosophies while
                                focusing on the outdoor environment as the primary learning space. Educators act as
                                facilitators of children’s learning, providing stimulation and support only as needed.
                                We nurture children’s innate curiosity, creativity and healthy risk-taking in the
                                outdoors, which enables them to connect and grow independently, and as community
                                members. Outdoor Preschool aims to promote equity, while actively challenging prejudices
                                and injustices through anti-bias education. Through meaningful interactions in nature,
                                children learn how to take care of themselves, and how to respect themselves, each
                                other, and the Earth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our program emphasizes social and environmental responsibility with the goal of
                                providing contextually and developmentally appropriate educational care. We acknowledge,
                                encourage and respect that each child (and their family) brings diversity to our
                                community. Educators routinely reflect on their own cultural and social identities,
                                attitudes, strengths and challenges while embracing and facilitating expression of
                                similarities and differences in the community. The program is flexibly structured to
                                balance the needs of individual children, along with the needs of the group.

                        <p>Outdoor Preschool is part of a growing movement across communities worldwide for more nature-based
                        early learning programs. Outdoor learning contributes to a more positive and sustainable future for our
                        planet as it provides greater understanding of and connection to the natural world we live in. </p>
                            <h3>Play</h3>
                            <p>Outdoor Preschool emphasizes a child’s right to play which is a child’s work. We plan for
                                at least 3 hours of child-led, unstructured play time each day. Although children’s play
                                might appear simple and repetitive, they often demonstrate tremendous mastery of complex
                                concepts. For example, a 4-year-old pretending to fly a plane by sitting on top of a
                                fallen tree is using her imagination to construct symbolic meaning, a complicated
                                cognitive task. She might ask peers to join her and act as passengers, which reveals her
                                developing ability to collaborate with others. Researchers have documented significant
                                impacts of play in terms of school readiness and healthy development of the brain,
                                including social, emotional and physical skills<sup>4,6</sup>. Ultimately, play enables children
                                to direct their own creative learning processes and guide their own development.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Physical Activity</h3>
                            <p>Our program incorporates a high amount of physical activity, especially because we are
                                outside much more often than traditional preschool programs. Research shows that nearly
                                half of preschool children do not get enough active play, also referred to as moderate
                                to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)<sup>9</sup>. Current governmental guidelines recommend that
                                children ages 3-5 years old engage in at least 60 minutes of MVPA/active play each day.
                                We provide children with 3+ hours of outdoor play each day. The outdoor environment is
                                more likely to encourage active play (MVPA) compared to indoor environments<sup>5</sup>.  We
                                designed our program with the knowledge that children are healthier in the long-term,
                                more able to learn and better able to self-regulate when their entire bodies are
                                actively engaged in their work<sup>1,7</sup>.

                            <h3>Engaging with Nature</h3>
                            <p>The natural world presents a huge variety of learning opportunities, health and wellness
                                benefits. Experts agree that time spent outside encourages positive social, cognitive,
                                emotional and physical development<sup>3</sup>. When it comes to the best environments for
                                children’s learning, the natural world promotes the ideal balance of healthy risks,
                                challenges and fun. Children and adults experience restorative cognitive functioning,
                                improved motor skills and lower stress levels when interacting with or looking at nature compared to non-natural,
                                urban environments<sup>2,10,11</sup>.  Additionally, some children have shown to have enhanced ability to concentrate
                                 when spending time near natural environments<sup>8</sup>.

                                <li><b>Are snacks and lunch provided?</b><br/>
                                    Yes and No. Lunch is not provided. Snacks are provided. We always offer organic,
                                    vegan snacks in the morning and afternoon in order to reduce our carbon footprint
                                    and nourish our bodies. We recommend zero-waste lunches that use reusable packaging
                                    and promote healthy eating habits. If children forget their lunch at home, the
                                    following items will be available:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Fresh, organic fruits and vegetables, such as apples, pears, carrots and peppers</li>
                                        <li>Organic, vegan crackers and whole grain bread</li>
                                        <li>Organic hummus and black bean dip</li>
                                    </ul>

                                <li><b>How far do you travel?</b><br/>
                                    When children are newly enrolled, our adventure hikes will consist of about ½ -1½
                                    miles total distance walking. As children grow stronger and more familiar with the
                                    routine, we can walk up to 3 miles in a morning.
                                </li>

                                <li><b>What is anti-bias education and why is it important?</b><br/>
                                    Research has shown that children as young as 3-4 years old have developed biases
                                    around differences such as skin color and ability. At Outdoor Preschool we want to
                                    promote equity and justice by actively combating bias and prejudice. The anti-bias
                                    education approach supports children to identify and talk about differences and
                                    similarities. We emphasize feeling comfortable and proud of unique attributes and
                                    common humanity.

                                    Families are always welcome and encouraged to visit the school. Outdoor Preschool
                                    loves to have visitors help out and teach us new things whether it is for 5 minutes,
                                    45 minutes or a day. We ask that families who are visiting, dress appropriately for
                                    the weather, including wearing similar items that we ask children to wear in order
                                    to model appropriate gear. When participating in Outdoor Preschool, we ask families
                                    to adhere to the following policies:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Adults do not help children climb higher than the child can climb by him or herself.</li>
                                        <li>We can pick up material that is no longer living and we avoid picking up items that are still alive.</li>
                                        <li>Children may take home pieces that are smaller than a finger and inanimate.</li>
                                        <li>We can use sticks for walking if the child can adequately control their motion and sticks may be incorporated into play if they are responsibly moved.</li>
                                        <li>Smoking is prohibited on all school property.</li>

                                <p>I was fortunate to have Annabelle work for me as an intern.  Annabelle brings a needed vitality and a passion to this very adult work.  She is patient, kind, playful and resourceful while working with little ones. Her ease in the natural world, her enthusiasm for sharing her love of nature with others and her dedication to making a difference in the lives of children all contribute to her ability to offer an outstanding nature-awareness preschool.  I fully endorse Annabelle in this work and know that families who enroll their children in Annabelle’s school will be very grateful they did.</p>
                                <p>As founder, director and teacher of my own nature-based preschool now for 27 years, I can say with some authority that there is no doubt that children benefit from time out in the natural world.  It is a great gift to give, that of unhurried time exploring, discovering and learning about the natural world through play-based activities.  That is what my program has offered and has given children for almost three decades.  Cognitive, physical, psycho/social/emotional  benefits are all documented outcomes for children who have the opportunity to spend decent amounts of time playing outside.  Nature education during early childhood  is an antidote to a sedentary lifestyle, an antidote to screen over-exposure in our young ones and a way for children to learn reverence and respect for the natural world of which we are all a part and for which we share responsibility.  Allowing young children time to participate in a nature-based preschool is a gift that lasts a lifetime.</p>

Annabelle thinks carefully about everything she does in the classroom. As a result of her careful planning, she is a very effective communicator and teacher. Annabelle reflects daily on how her teaching is going and adapts her lessons constantly to meet the needs of the individuals she is working with.

                                Annabelle was an educator in our play based program where she gently guided the children with compassion, caring and authenticity.  Annabelle respected each child's individuality and uniqueness.  She listened so attentively to the children giving them space and time to develop self-reliance and autonomy.  Annabelle shared her passion for the outdoors and nature with the children by means of everyday experiences - watching clouds float by, examining the colors in a leaf or watching a trail of ants in the sand.  Learning about nature in nature is vital for all children. Through her outdoor preschool I’m confident Annabelle will continue to develop children’s natural curiosity and foster in children a love of, respect for and connection to the natural world.
