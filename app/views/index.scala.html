                            <p>
                               The curriculum emerges primarily from the natural world, children’s interests, play, and daily routines. Children’s self-directed
                                activities, especially in the outdoors inspire play scenarios, class discussions, and projects that extend over weeks and months.
                                Children develop skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective decision-making while accomplishing meaningful tasks.
                                Educators also guide explorations of family and community to reinforce group connections and healthy identity development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout daily activities, educators support children’s emotional, social, physical, and cognitive 
                                development. The physical environment is an unlimited source of rhythm, patterns, and inspiration for small and large 
                                group projects and investigations that incorporate science, math, language arts, social studies, and creative arts. The 
                                program includes high-quality learning methods and materials such as diverse genres of literature, storytelling, woodworking and baking 
                                activities, songs and fingerplays, developmentally appropriate technology, musical instruments, fine arts and natural materials 
                                found in nature.

                                Educators document individual progress using portfolio-based assessment. Portfolio entries include pieces of work,
                                photos, videos, and written notes collected over time by educators and children. Throughout the process, children are 
                                encouraged to self-reflect on their learning and feel proud of their individual growth. Educators use their expertise 
                                in child development and examine current research to inform appropriate learning goals (i.e. scientific reasoning, mathematical 
                                thinking, language, communication, social, emotional, and physical achievements).

                                Forest School offers an early childhood environmental education program that nurtures children’s development and connections with nature. We
                                support a diverse and inclusive community of children, families, and educators who respect and care for themselves, each other,
                                and the Earth.
                            <p>   
                                Forest School gives equal treatment and access to our program and to current or prospective employees without discrimination

                            <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                            <p>
                                Forest School incorporates child-centered, inquiry and play-based educational philosophies. 
                                Our Guiding Principles are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Nature provides an ideal context for child-led learning</li>
                                    <li>Children and families are competent, capable, and resilient</li>
                                    <li>Diversity and inclusion are essential in all aspects of the school</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Children develop respect and compassion for themselves, each other, and the environment when given opportunities to 
                              ask questions, take risks, explore and discover their world. Educators guide children’s investigations, and design 
                              and maintain indoor and outdoor spaces. In addition to providing respectful caregiving, staff mentor and partner with 
                              children to support their strengths, challenges, and unique identities. We challenge stereotypes and unfairness through 
                              inclusive conversations and stories. We value and advocate for families, their diversity, unique perspectives and expert 
                              knowledge of their children.

                        <div class="modal-body">
                        <p>Forest Schools are different from traditional early childhood education programs because educators empower children to 
                        explore, interpret, and apply new skills and knowledge outside in wild spaces. The (insert school name) philosophy follows 
                        the principles of Forest School by enriching children’s learning and development while fostering deep connections and 
                        sustainable relationships with the natural world. </p>

                            <h3>Play</h3>
                            <p>Forest School emphasizes a child’s right to play which is essential to learning and healthy development<sup>4</sup>. 
                            Our program incorporates at least 3-4 hours of child-directed play outdoors each day. Child-directed play enables 
                            children to problem-solve, make their own decisions, collaborate with peers, and test evolving theories of how the 
                            world works<sup>2</sup>. In addition to providing time for free play, educators use guided play approaches such as preparing 
                            materials based on children’s interests and posing open-ended questions to focus and extend learning<sup>14</sup>. Research 
                            shows that unstructured and guided play, with the support of nurturing and respectful educators, are effective for 
                            developing school/life readiness (i.e. social, emotional, cognitive, and physical skills)<sup>4,9,14</sup>. Some research also 
                            demonstrates that guided play approaches are more effective for children’s learning outcomes in math and literacy than 
                            academic or free play approaches<sup>15</sup>.
                            </p>
                             <h3>Engaging with Nature</h3>
                            <p>The natural world presents a variety of unique learning opportunities, health, and wellness benefits. Experts agree that 
                            time spent outside supports positive social, cognitive, emotional, and physical development<sup>2,3</sup>. Studies show that children 
                            who interact with nature have improved motor skills, language, concentration, emotional regulation, and lower stress levels<sup>7,12,16</sup>. 
                            There is also evidence that spending more time outside reduces the incidence of nearsightedness<sup>5</sup>. Furthermore, 
                            researchers have found links between the amount of time young people spend in nature, their appreciation and connection to 
                            the natural world, and their attitudes towards caring for it in the future<sup>3</sup>. 
                            </p>
                            <h3>Physical Activity</h3>
                            <p>Children are more likely to engage in physical activity outdoors<sup>11</sup>. Health agencies recommend that preschool children 
                            engage in at least 60-120 minutes of physical activity every day<sup>6,13</sup>. While research shows that children in preschool 
                            settings spend most of their time inactive indoors, at least 70% of our program day offers active outdoor play opportunities<sup>8,11</sup>.
                            Our program is designed so that children are healthier in the long-term, better able to self-regulate, and more able to learn because 
                            their entire bodies are actively engaged<sup>1,10</sup>.

                                    Yes! If weather conditions drop below 15 degrees or above 90 degrees Fahrenheit,
                                    there is heavy precipitation, thunder, lightning or high winds, children’s time

                                    Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) website for wind chill and frostbite risk. 
                                    We have many options for indoor activities in our schoolhouse that help children 
                                    build connections with nature. For example, educators offer natural elements such as clay, sticks, and pine cones 
                                    during extended time indoors.

                                <li><b>Are there requirements for this program?</b><br/>
                                    Yes. All children need to be 3&#189; years of age by the time they are enrolled and
                                    attending classes. Additionally, children need to be using the toilet independently and properly
                                    dressed for the outdoors. Please read ‘Required Clothing and Gear’ in the Family
                                    Handbook for further information. If you need assistance acquiring gear, 
                                    please ask an educator for additional information. There are affordable second-hand 
                                    stores and local resources that can help.

                                    The lead educator, Annabelle Knight, has a Master’s Degree in Early Childhood Education from Lesley University and has been teaching professionally since 2010.
                                    She is licensed by the VT Agency of Education and certified by the VT Child Development Division.  
                                </li>
                                
                                <li><b>How can you keep children safe outside?</b><br/>
                                    While there are unique hazards associated with outdoor learning, safety is our first priority. Educators carry backpacks
                                    with safety supplies and cell phones, are First Aid/CPR Certified, and have been trained in a comprehensive set of 
                                    emergency preparedness plans and procedures. We conduct daily safety routines including headcounts and risk assessments 
                                    of individuals, materials, and the environment. Children work with staff to identify and discuss boundaries, potential 
                                    hazards, and what to do when they hear a safety whistle. While all children must stay within sight and earshot of an adult, 
                                    each child is given a safety whistle and instructed how to use it in an emergency. During warmer months, families need to 
                                    help protect children from <a href="http://healthvermont.gov/prevent/zoonotic/tickborne/resources.aspx" target="_blank">ticks</a> by checking their skin each day.

                                <li><b>What is anti-bias education and why is it important?</b><br/>
                                    Research has shown that children as young as 3-4 years old have developed biases around differences 
                                    such as skin color and ability. We want to challenge bias and 
                                    prejudice in everyday life. We emphasize feeling comfortable and proud of unique attributes and common 
                                    humanity. For example, children’s books are closely examined by educators and children for stereotypical 
                                    reflections of people and families. Educators encourage open discussion of character portrayals, differences 
                                    and similarities in an effort to achieve the anti-bias goals outlined below.

                                    Snacks are provided. Lunch is not provided. Packed lunch foods must be non-perishable due to the nature of our outdoor program and state 
                                    licensing regulations. We recommend zero-waste lunches that use reusable packaging and promote healthy eating habits. We offer healthy snacks
                                    in the morning and afternoon. When possible, we source local food that has been grown using organic practices. We also work with families 
                                    around children's particular allergies and dietary needs. Snacks provided may include:

                                        <li>Fresh fruits and vegetables, such as apples, pears, carrots and peppers</li>
                                        <li>Whole grain bread, crackers, gluten-free rice cakes</li>

                                    Yes. Time spent in nature and high-quality play have been shown to support children’s learning and development of 
                                    foundational skills and complex cognitive tasks needed for academic work. Children will leave the program with a 
                                    love of learning, creativity, resilience, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills to help them adapt and thrive 
                                    in new environments.

                                <p>I was fortunate to have Annabelle work for me as an intern.  Annabelle brings a needed vitality and a passion to this very adult work.  She is patient, kind, playful and resourceful while working with little ones. Her ease in the natural world, her enthusiasm for sharing her love of nature with others and her dedication to making a difference in the lives of children all contribute to her ability to offer an outstanding nature-awareness preschool.  I fully endorse Annabelle in this work and know that families who enroll their children in Annabelle’s school will be very grateful they did.</p>
                                <p>As founder, director and teacher of my own nature-based preschool now for 27 years, I can say with some authority that there is no doubt that children benefit from time out in the natural world.  It is a great gift to give, that of unhurried time exploring, discovering and learning about the natural world through play-based activities.  That is what my program has offered and has given children for almost three decades.  Cognitive, physical, psycho/social/emotional  benefits are all documented outcomes for children who have the opportunity to spend decent amounts of time playing outside.  Nature education during early childhood  is an antidote to a sedentary lifestyle, an antidote to screen over-exposure in our young ones and a way for children to learn reverence and respect for the natural world of which we are all a part and for which we share responsibility.  Allowing young children time to participate in a nature-based preschool is a gift that lasts a lifetime.</p>

Annabelle reflects daily on how her teaching is going and adapts her lessons constantly to meet the needs of the individuals she is working with.

Annabelle respected each child's individuality and uniqueness.  She listened so attentively to the children giving them space and time to develop self-reliance and autonomy.  Annabelle shared her passion for the outdoors and nature with the children by means of everyday experiences - watching clouds float by, examining the colors in a leaf or watching a trail of ants in the sand.  Learning about nature in nature is vital for all children. Through her outdoor preschool I’m confident Annabelle will continue to develop children’s natural curiosity and foster in children a love of, respect for and connection to the natural world.
