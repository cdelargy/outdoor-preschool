                    <p>The Forest School program was established in Vermont in 2015 by Annabelle Knight. In 2012-2013 
                        while working as an early childhood educator on the west coast, Annabelle began researching and learning about the benefits of nature immersion programs for young 
                        children. She met Magdalena Cabrera, owner and head teacher of a nature awareness preschool in Northern 
                        California since 1988. After interning with Magdalena, Annabelle was inspired to own and operate a forest
                        school program for children and families on the east coast closer to where she grew up.

                            <h3>Curriculum</h3>
                            <p>
                                The curriculum emerges from childrenâ€™s interests, relationships, daily routines, and play. The physical environment 
                                is an unlimited source of rhythm, patterns, and inspiration for small and large group projects and investigations that
                                incorporate science, math, language arts, social studies, and creative arts. Childrenâ€™s daily experiences include 
                                opportunities to create, explore, and learn about similarities and differences among people while challenging stereotypes
                                and bias with critical thinking and problem-solving. Educators incorporate high-quality learning methods and materials 
                                including literature, songs, fingerplays, fine arts materials, musical instruments, natural materials found in nature, 
                                and developmentally appropriate technology.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Assessment</h3>
                            <p> 
                                Educators document individual progress using portfolio-based assessment. Portfolio entries include pieces of work,
                                photos, videos, and written notes collected over time by educators and children. Throughout the process, children are 
                                encouraged to self-reflect on their learning journey and feel proud of their individual growth. Educators use their expertise 
                                in child development and examine current research to inform appropriate learning goals (i.e. scientific reasoning, mathematical 
                                thinking, language, communication, social, emotional and physical development).

                                Forest School offers an early childhood environmental education program that nurtures childrenâ€™s holistic development and lasting connections with nature. We
                                support a diverse and inclusive community of children and families who respect and care for themselves, each other,
                                and the Earth.
                            <p>   
                                Forest School gives equal treatment and access to our program and to our current or prospective employees without regard to race, gender, color, religious 
                                creed, national origin or ancestry, ethnic group orientation, medical condition, age, socioeconomic status, marital status,
                                family structure, disability, pregnancy or sexual orientation.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                            <p>
                                Forest School believes in child-centered, inquiry and play-based educational philosophies. 
                                Our Guiding Principles are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Children are competent, capable, and resilient</li>
                                    <li>Nature stimulates children's curiosity</li>
                                    <li>Relationships are foundational to learning</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              We believe children develop respect and compassion for themselves, each other, and the environment when given 
                              opportunities to take risks, make connections, explore, and discover their world. We understand that childrenâ€™s 
                              innate curiosity invites meaningful context for inquiry-based learning and outdoor immersion inspires childrenâ€™s 
                              imagination, creativity, and practical skill development. Our program provides a trusting and supportive environment 
                              for children to develop self-confidence, empathy, social and environmental responsibility.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               Educators practice anti-bias approaches to learning to promote equity, justice and social responsibility, so that all 
                               children feel empowered to reach their full potential. In addition to being respectful caregivers, educators act as 
                               gentle facilitators, mentors, and co-learners supportive of each childâ€™s unique identity, strengths, and challenges. 
                               We value and advocate for families, their diversity, unique perspectives and expert knowledge of their children.

                        <div class="modal-body">
                        <p>Forest School is part of a growing movement across communities worldwide for more nature-immersion
                        early learning programs. The methodology of Forest School (similar to Forest Kindergartens, Rain or Shine
                        Schools, Nature Kindergartens, and Nature Preschools) is validated by growing international research that
                        outdoor-based education programs enrich childrenâ€™s learning and development while fostering deep connections
                        and sustainable relationships with the natural environment. </p>

                            <h3>Play</h3>
                            <p>Forest School emphasizes a childâ€™s right to play in nature. Our program incorporates
                                at least 3-4 hours of free, child-centered play outdoors each day. Although childrenâ€™s play
                                might appear simple and repetitive, they are demonstrating tremendous creativity and mastery of complex
                                concepts. For example, a 4-year-old pretending to fly a plane by sitting on top of a
                                fallen tree is using her imagination to construct symbolic meaning, a complicated
                                cognitive task. She might ask peers to join her and act as passengers which reveals her
                                developing ability to communicate and collaborate with others. Researchers have documented significant 
                                evidence that unstructured play contributes to school readiness and is valuable for healthy brain development 
                                including social, emotional, and physical skills<sup>4,6</sup>. Ultimately, play enables children
                                to direct their own learning and development.
                            </p>
                             <h3>Engaging with Nature</h3>
                            <p>The natural world presents a huge variety of learning opportunities, health and wellness
                                benefits. Furthermore, it is crucial for children to spend time interacting with and appreciating nature
                                if we want to promote a sustainable planet for future generations. Experts agree that time spent outside encourages positive social, cognitive,
                                emotional and physical development<sup>3</sup>. When it comes to the best environments for
                                childrenâ€™s learning, the natural world promotes the ideal balance of healthy risks,
                                challenges and fun. Children and adults experience restorative cognitive functioning,
                                improved motor skills and lower stress levels when interacting with or looking at nature compared to non-natural,
                                urban environments<sup>2,10,11</sup>.  Additionally, some children have shown to have enhanced ability to concentrate
                                 when spending time near natural environments<sup>8</sup>. 
                            </p>
                            <h3>Physical Activity</h3>
                            <p>The outdoor environment is more likely to encourage active play (also referred to as MVPA or moderate to vigorous physical activity)<sup>5</sup>.
                                Research shows that nearly half of preschool children do not get enough active play or MVPA<sup>9</sup>. Current governmental guidelines recommend that
                                children ages 3-5 engage in at least 60 minutes of MVPA every day.
                                We provide children with 2-3 more hours on average of outdoor play each day than typical preschools. Our program is designed with the knowledge that children are healthier in the long-term,
                                more able to learn, and better able to self-regulate when their entire bodies are
                                actively engaged<sup>1,7</sup>.

                                    Yes! If weather conditions drop below 15 degrees or above 90 degrees Fahrenheit,
                                    there is heavy precipitation, thunder, lightning or high winds, childrenâ€™s time
                                    outdoors will be limited. Educators follow exposure recommendations from the National
                                    Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) website for wind chill and frostbite risk. 
                                    We have many options for indoor activities in our home-like schoolhouse that help children 
                                    build connections with nature. For example, we incorporate clay, sticks, and pine cones 
                                    during indoor play.
                                </li>

                                <li><b>Are there requirements for this program?</b><br/>
                                    Yes. All children must have turned 3&#189; years of age by the time they are enrolled and
                                    attending classes. Additionally, children must be toilet-trained and properly
                                    dressed for the outdoors. Please read â€˜Required Clothing and Gearâ€™ in the Family
                                    Handbook for further information.

                                <li><b>What is your teacher to child ratio?</b><br/>
                                    We aim to enroll 6-9 children during the first year, so the maximum staff to child ratio is 1:6 while the minimum is 1:4Â½.

                                    She is licensed by the VT Agency of Education and certified by the VT Child Development Division.  
                                </li>
                                <li><b>How can you keep children safe outside?</b><br/>
                                    While there are unique hazards associated with outdoor learning, safety is our top priority. Educators are 
                                    First Aid/CPR Certified and practice daily safety routines, such as conducting daily risk assessments of 
                                    the natural environment, identifying and discussing boundaries and potential hazards with the children, always carrying a cell phone, 
                                    asking that all children must be within sight of an adult and using whistles and songs to alert children. During warmer months, families
                                    need to help protect children from ticks by checking their skin each day.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Are snacks and lunch provided?</b><br/>
                                    Yes and No. Lunch is not provided. Snacks are provided. We always offer healthy snacks in the morning and afternoon. 
                                    When possible, we source local food that has been grown using organic practices. We also work with families around children's particular allergies, restrictions and sensitivities. 
                                    We recommend zero-waste lunches that use reusable packaging
                                    and promote healthy eating habits. If children forget their lunch at home, the
                                    following items will be available:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Fresh fruits and vegetables, such as apples, pears, carrots and peppers</li>
                                        <li>Whole grain bread, crackers, gluten-free rice cakes</li>
                                        <li>Hummus and black bean dip</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li><b>How far do you travel?</b><br/>
                                    When children are newly enrolled, our adventure hikes will consist of about Â½ -1Â½
                                    miles total distance walking. As children grow stronger and more familiar with the
                                    routine, we can walk up to 3 miles in a morning.
                                </li>

                                <li><b>What is anti-bias education and why is it important?</b><br/>
                                    Research has shown that children as young as 3-4 years old have developed biases around differences 
                                    such as skin color and ability. We want to promote equity and justice by actively challenging bias and 
                                    prejudice in everyday life. We emphasize feeling comfortable and proud of unique attributes and common 
                                    humanity. For example, childrenâ€™s books are closely examined by educators and children for stereotypical 
                                    reflections of people and families. Educators encourage open discussion of character portrayals, differences 
                                    and similarities in an effort to achieve the anti-bias goals outlined below.

                                    Families are always welcome and encouraged to visit the school. We
                                    love to have visitors help out and teach us new things whether it is for 5 minutes,
                                    45 minutes or a day. We ask that families who are visiting, dress appropriately for
                                    the weather, including wearing similar items that we ask children to wear in order
                                    to model appropriate gear. When participating, we ask families
                                    to adhere to the following policies:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Adults do not help children climb higher than the child can climb by him or herself.</li>
                                        <li>We avoid picking up items that are still alive.</li>
                                        <li>Children may take home pieces that are smaller than a finger and inanimate.</li>
                                        <li>We can use sticks as long as the child has enough space.</li>
                                        <li>Smoking is prohibited on all school property.</li>

                                <p>I was fortunate to have Annabelle work for me as an intern.  Annabelle brings a needed vitality and a passion to this very adult work.  She is patient, kind, playful and resourceful while working with little ones. Her ease in the natural world, her enthusiasm for sharing her love of nature with others and her dedication to making a difference in the lives of children all contribute to her ability to offer an outstanding nature-awareness preschool.  I fully endorse Annabelle in this work and know that families who enroll their children in Annabelleâ€™s school will be very grateful they did.</p>
                                <p>As founder, director and teacher of my own nature-based preschool now for 27 years, I can say with some authority that there is no doubt that children benefit from time out in the natural world.  It is a great gift to give, that of unhurried time exploring, discovering and learning about the natural world through play-based activities.  That is what my program has offered and has given children for almost three decades.  Cognitive, physical, psycho/social/emotional  benefits are all documented outcomes for children who have the opportunity to spend decent amounts of time playing outside.  Nature education during early childhood  is an antidote to a sedentary lifestyle, an antidote to screen over-exposure in our young ones and a way for children to learn reverence and respect for the natural world of which we are all a part and for which we share responsibility.  Allowing young children time to participate in a nature-based preschool is a gift that lasts a lifetime.</p>

Annabelle thinks carefully about everything she does in the classroom. As a result of her careful planning, she is a very effective communicator and teacher. Annabelle reflects daily on how her teaching is going and adapts her lessons constantly to meet the needs of the individuals she is working with.

                                Annabelle was an educator in our play based program where she gently guided the children with compassion, caring and authenticity.  Annabelle respected each child's individuality and uniqueness.  She listened so attentively to the children giving them space and time to develop self-reliance and autonomy.  Annabelle shared her passion for the outdoors and nature with the children by means of everyday experiences - watching clouds float by, examining the colors in a leaf or watching a trail of ants in the sand.  Learning about nature in nature is vital for all children. Through her outdoor preschool Iâ€™m confident Annabelle will continue to develop childrenâ€™s natural curiosity and foster in children a love of, respect for and connection to the natural world.
